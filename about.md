The hope of the blog is to educate myself about different aspects of software engineering professionally as well as different tools out there.

Most of my professional work is written in Clojure (I highly recommend giving it a try), but I'll most likely branch into different languages at different times too.

If I make anything interesting I'll post about it here too.
