No software blog would be complete without a Hello World, so here's mine.

This blog basically exists to help me stop being lazy and actually follow through on things I think about doing. The hope is that my many followers (completely imaginary so far but you never know) will exert so much peer pressure that I can't help but do interesting things.

Most of my real-world programming experience comes in the form of Clojure so I'll likely be talking about that for the most part, at least in the beginning. There's no real limits though, so anything that takes my fancy could be fair game.

So watch this space for a trip into software that will most likely be loaded with mistakes and misunderstanding, but hopefully contain the odd helpful tidbit here and there.
